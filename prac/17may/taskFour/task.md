- we have to make a log application, which render data coming from the api into the dom

  - it should render in the window
    like this.

```js
const messages = [
  { name: "rony", list: ["orange", "lemon"] },
  { name: "pony", list: ["papaya", "orange", "ice", "slice", "warm"] },
];
```

```
- hi my name is {name} , i have {2} list items which are {item1}, {item2}
- hi my name is {name} , i have {5} list items which are {item1}, {item2}, {item3}, {item4}, {item5}
```
