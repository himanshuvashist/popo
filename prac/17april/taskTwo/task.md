 - Make have to make an application which take two number and show its addition upon clicking the button.
    - we have to make two inputs and a button, after user enter number in both of the input and clicks on the button
    then addition of those two number should be visible below it on the website.
    (no console.log should be in the last code, but can be used for dubbuging while developing the application.)
